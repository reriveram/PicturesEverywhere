### Approach

PicturesEverywhere was developed around harnessing the capabilities of React Native and integrating specialized libraries to create a feature-rich photography app. The combination of [react-native-vision-camera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera) for capturing pictures, [react-native-community/geolocation](https://github.com/michalchudziak/react-native-geolocation) for location services, [react-native-async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) for local data storage, and [react-native-share](https://github.com/react-native-share/react-native-share) for effortless sharing ensures a holistic and delightful user experience.
